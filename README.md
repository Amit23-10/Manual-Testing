# Manual Testing (Acceptance Criteria, Test Case & Bug reporting)

### This task involves acceptance criterias,test cases for two different scenarios in the standard format and report some bugs for a open source website https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com according to their appropriate priority and severity level.

## Scenario 1 :
In an MFS mobile app named EasyPay, customers can pay any merchant or utility bill. For each payment, a 1% service charge will be deducted from the customer's balance, with a minimum transaction fee of 5 tk. If a customer has already made transactions totaling 5000 tk for a month, they will receive a 20% cashback for any subsequent payments upto 5000 tk. Moreover, if the customer has already completed transactions totaling 10000 tk for a month, they will receive a 50% cashback for any further payments upto 5000 tk.


## Scenario 2 :

If a customer has a balance of less than 100 tk, they can apply for a loan of up to 20000 tk. If the customer repays the loan within 30 days from the loan initiation day, no interest will be charged. However, if the customer fails to repay within this period, a daily interest of 1.8% will be applied in a compound interest manner on the remaining amount.
Additionally, if a customer has already paid 50% of the remaining payment, they are eligible to apply for another loan.
